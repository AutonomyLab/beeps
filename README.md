A repository of sounds and sound-generating code we created or collected for use in robot experiments.

This public repo allows us to refer readers of our papers to the sounds we use in experiments. If other people find the sounds useful, that's good too. If you use these sounds, please cite this repo, and pay attention to the license details, which may vary for each sound.
